## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Pre-processor

### What I learned

I learnt that images should be properly imported into the source code so that the code bundler can correctly replace the image symbol references after file names are hashed. The hashing behaviour for asset files is the default when using Vite and is something to consider if file name hashing has been setup declaritively in Webpack.
